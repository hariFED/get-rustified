#hello

I am creating this repo for learning purpose it may contian bugs

Let me clear out why i am creating this repo and i will use this repo as zero-ai which means from readme to any thing that gets into this repo is human typed still i may not able to prove you that but fuck off this is my repo and its to show only that i am true to myself 

note: zero-ai means its not that i am not going to use ai anywhere but i will only use ai to clear doubts get knowledge and acquire skills to make me zero-ai depandable on rust as far as i know 

*i am not here to become a legend in the rust i am here to learn rust so that i could flex that i know rust.

if you feal hurt yes i hurt you so do you work and hate me
